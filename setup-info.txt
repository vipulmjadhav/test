ERROR while pulling the contents from remote to origin 
>>Permission denied (publickey).

Root Cause :remote repo doesnot recognise that which host is trying to connect with it.

Solution :

1. Create an ssh key on your machine (windows)
C:\Users\vipul\.ssh >> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jadhavipul933@gmail.com"
(if .ssh folder is not present create one)

2. add into github keys (https://github.com/settings/keys)

>>type C:\Users\vipul\.ssh\id_rsa.pub

paste the key starting from ssh-rsa into github keys.
